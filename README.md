Description: (From the authors of mod)  
In 2013, among the ruins of an ancient Mayan city, the remains of a refuge of an unknown cult were found, which disappeared long ago under unknown circumstances. The best experts in the world were engaged in the mystery, but no one could explain the origin of the oldest walls and columns made of extraterrestrial stone with carved panoramas of incredible fantastic worlds... When archaeologists unearthed another artifact, it turned out to be a portal from which hordes of terrible, beautiful, and simply amazing creatures poured out. In order to deter the invasion of creatures, special forces strike groups are landing in the archaeological complex with one goal - to destroy all witnesses and fill the complex with concrete... The work was masterfully done, but one of the archaeologists managed to survive...  
Trying to escape, he jumped into the portal...
